# Data Ingestion with dlt

## Understanding Data Ingestion

Data ingestion involves extracting data from various sources, transporting it to a suitable environment, and preparing it for analysis. This process often includes normalizing, cleaning, and adding metadata to the data.

In many data science teams, datasets don't magically appear ready for analysis. Often, data engineers are responsible for sourcing and structuring this data. While some datasets, like the NYC Taxi dataset, are well-structured and readily available, many others require significant preprocessing.

- **Structured Data**: Data with an explicit schema, such as Parquet or Avro files, can be used immediately.

- **Unstructured Data**: Data without a defined schema, like CSV or JSON files, often requires cleaning and formatting before use.

A **schema** defines the expected format and structure of data, including field names, data types, and relationships.


As data engineers, our role is to make datasets "magically" appear in a usable format. To build effective pipelines, we must master:

- **Extracting Data**: Sourcing data from APIs, databases, or files.

- **Normalizing Data**: Transforming, cleaning, and defining schemas.

- **Loading Data**: Storing data in data warehouses, lakes, or databases.

## The Power of Data Pipelines

Data pipelines are the backbone of modern data-driven organizations. They transform raw, scattered data into actionable insights, ensuring seamless data flow from source to destination.

### Key Functions of Data Pipelines

1. **Collect**: Gather information from various sources, ensuring no data is overlooked.

2. **Ingest**: Organize and prepare collected data for processing.

3. **Store**: Send processed data to storage solutions like data lakes or warehouses.

### Common Data Sources

- **RESTful APIs**: Provide records from business applications.

- **File-based APIs**: Return secure file paths to bulk data stored in buckets.

- **Database APIs**: Connect to databases like MongoDB or SQL, often returning data as JSON.

## Introducing dlt: Simplifying Data Pipelines

**dlt** (data load tool) is an open-source Python library that automates many tedious data engineering tasks, enabling you to build robust, scalable, and self-maintaining pipelines with ease.

### Key Features of dlt

- **Automatic Pagination**: Fetches all pages of data without manual intervention.

- **Low Memory Usage**: Streams data in chunks to prevent RAM overflows.

- **Rate Limit Handling & Retries**: Manages request rates and retries efficiently.

- **Flexible Destination Support**: Loads data into various storage solutions, including databases, warehouses, and data lakes.

## Hands-On with dlt

Let's walk through building a data ingestion pipeline using dlt.

### 1. Setting Up Your Environment

First, install dlt using pip:

```bash
pip install dlt

### 2. Extracting Data from an API

We'll extract data from a RESTful API. Here's how:

```python
import dlt
import requests

# Define the API endpoint
api_url = 'https://api.example.com/data'

# Create a dlt pipeline
pipeline = dlt.pipeline(destination='your_destination', dataset_name='your_dataset')

# Define a function to extract data
@dlt.resource
def extract_data():
    response = requests.get(api_url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()

# Run the pipeline with the extract function
pipeline.run(extract_data)
